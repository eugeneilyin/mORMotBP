This is a modified version of the Build Options package from:

https://kurapaty.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/build-events-for-delphi-5-7/

Besides Delphi 5/7 it was adopted to use with Delphi 6/2005/2006 to cover all 
IDE versions which are don't have the Build Events feature which appeared in Delphi 2007.

To install package into IDE do the next:

  Component / Install Packages / Add

  BuildEventsD5.bpl for Delphi 5
  BuildEventsD6.bpl for Delphi 6
  BuildEventsD7.bpl for Delphi 7
  BuildEventsD2005.bpl for Delphi 2005
  BuildEventsD2006.bpl for Delphi 2006

Then Build Events will be available in the next IDE menu:

  Project / Build Events

The next Macros provided by default:

  BDS              The environment variable "BDS" or Delphi IDE root directory
  DEFINES          The project's conditional defines
  DIR              The environment variable "DIR"

  PROJECTDIR       The project's directory
  PROJECTEXT       The project's extension
  PROJECTFILENAME  The project file's name, with extension
  PROJECTNAME      The project's name
  PROJECTPATH      The project file's full path

  OUTPUTDIR        The output file's directory
  UNITOUTPUTDIR    The unit output file's directory

  Path             The environment variable "PATH"
  SystemRoot       The environment variable "SYSTEMROOT"
  TEMPDIR          The environment variable "TEMP" or (if empty) "TMP"
  WINDIR           The environment variable "WINDIR"

You can emulate DEBUG / RELEASE configurations by 
calling pre-build.bat or post-build.bat like this:

  Pre-build events: 

    "$(PROJECTDIR)\pre-build.bat" "$(DEFINES)"

  Post-build events: 
 
    "$(PROJECTDIR)\post-build.bat" "$(DEFINES)"

With the next *.bat file customization:

@ECHO OFF

SET DEFINES="%~1"
IF NOT x%DEFINES:DEBUG=%==x%DEFINES% GOTO DEBUG
IF NOT x%DEFINES:RELEASE=%==x%DEFINES% GOTO RELEASE
GOTO END


:DEBUG
ECHO DEBUG build processing
REM ... put your DEBUG commands here ...
GOTO END


:RELEASE
ECHO RELEASE build processing
REM ... put your RELEASE commands here ...
GOTO END


:END
REM ... put your common post-processing commands here ...
